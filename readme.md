## WEB3 Inbox

This is my first attempt at WEB3, so the idea is to just have a "Hello, World" project to get started.

### What is WEB3?

WEB3 is the future of the internet, where information is decentralized and not controlled by mega corporations. You have control over your data and you can choose to share it with others. It is a new way of thinking about the internet and how we interact with each other.

### This project

This project is a simple smart contract that stores a message. The message can be changed by the owner of the contract. The contract is deployed on the Sepolia test network.
